        <p1>I want my country back
         and a good dream to stand up for.
        Got my hand over my heart, 
        but I don't feel at home here anymore</p1>
        <p2>Big, big flag above the big, big mall,
         and the shake rattle and roll to the core.
         Things sprawl after they fall,
         and I don't feel at home here anymore</p2>
